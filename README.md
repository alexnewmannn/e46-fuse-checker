## Project information

This project is under active development, and as a result some accessibility issues or usability issues may be present.

The purpose of this app is for users of any BMW e46 who need to diagnose a parasitic draw from their battery or any other fuse related issues. The fuse diagram provided by the vehicle is hard to read (if you even have one!) and difficult to figure out how many shared fuses are within the car. This allows the user to search for a fuse and return all the equipment modules that share that fuse, and also allows the user to click individual fuse numbers.

This project is built using next.js, typescript and styled-components. It will be WCAG 2.1 compliant upon completion.
